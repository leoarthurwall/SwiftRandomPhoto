An App that randomly generates a photo from an API upon button click

The key functionality of the app is simple, however it was a great opportunity to get exposure to how API requests work with Swift.

In addition, I had the opportunity to build upon my UI skills and get more familiar with XCode and SwiftUI.

A few other learning points include:
